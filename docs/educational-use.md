# Educational Implementation Guide

This guide details how to implement ExplorerLLM in an educational setting.

## Overview
ExplorerLLM aims to enhance learning by providing customized language models tailored to specific courses and educational needs. This implementation guide covers setting up multiple courses, managing student data, and optimizing model usage.

## Course-Specific Setup

Deploying separate instances for each course ensures tailored interactions and data management.

### Creating Course Instances
1. **Directory Setup**: Make directories for each course.
   ```bash
   mkdir -p courses/{cs101,eng201,math150}
   ```

2. **Docker Compose Configuration**:
   - Copy `docker-compose.yml` to each course.
   - Edit the ports and volume names to avoid conflicts.
   ```bash
   cp docker-compose.yml courses/cs101/docker-compose-cs101.yml
   sed -i 's/3000/3001/g' courses/cs101/docker-compose-cs101.yml
   sed -i 's/ollama_/cs101_ollama_/g' courses/cs101/docker-compose-cs101.yml
   ```

3. **Start Services**:
   ```bash
   cd courses/cs101
   docker-compose -f docker-compose-cs101.yml up -d
   ```

## Model Sharing Across Courses

To save resources, share models between courses, while keeping course data separate.

```yaml
# Example in docker-compose.yml
volumes:
  - shared_models:/root/.ollama  # Shared model data
  - cs101_webui_data:/app/backend/data  # Course-specific data
```

## Student Data Management

Ensure compliance with privacy regulations (GDPR/FERPA):

1. **Data Anonymization**: Strip personally identifiable data where feasible.
2. **Data Retention Policies**: Implement automatic deletion policies for old data.
3. **Data Export**: Allow students and educators to export interactions.
4. **Role Segregation**: Implement admin and student roles to control data access.

## Enhancing Learning with Feedback

Incorporate student feedback:

1. **Regular Evaluations**: Solicit feedback frequently to adapt models based on educational outcomes.
2. **Fine-tuning**: Engage students in experiments to determine preferable models and settings.
3. **Performance Analytics**: Use logs and analytics to track engagement and improvement.

## Scaling and Performance

### Optimization Tips
- Use quantized models for faster load times.
- Monitor resource usage, scaling up as more courses are added.
- Employ caching strategies for frequently accessed information.

### Resource Planning
| Concurrent Users | RAM  | CPU   | Disk Space |
|------------------|------|-------|------------|
| 1-10             | 8GB  | 2 CPU | 50GB       |
| 10-50            | 16GB | 4 CPU | 100GB      |
| 50-200           | 32GB | 8 CPU | 200GB      |
| 200+             | 64GB | 16 CPU| 500GB+     |

## Future Development

The following features are in development and can further enhance educational applications:

- **Fine-tuning Pipelines**: Tailor models for specific educational outcomes effectively.
- **Integration with LMSs**: Tie LLM interactions into existing Learning Management Systems.
- **Enhanced Analytics Dashboard**: Provide deep insights into usage and student performance.

### Conclusion
ExplorerLLM provides a flexible and powerful platform for educational innovation. By adopting these practices, institutions can enhance the learning experience and maintain control over AI-driven interactions.
